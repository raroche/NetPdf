# Changelog

All notable changes to NetPdf are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The repository is **private through Phase 5**; tagged releases below are git tags only — NuGet publication happens at the v1.0 launch event (per `docs/phases/phase-5-packaging-and-release.md`).

## [Unreleased]

The `0.7.0-beta` entry below is **prepared for tagging** — version bumped, CHANGELOG written, exit criteria signed off — but the git tag is created by the maintainer after PR merge. Until tagged, treat the section as the staged contents of the next release. (The earlier `0.3.0-alpha` entry is staged the same way.) Post-`0.7.0-beta` improvements accumulate under **Unreleased** below until the next release is cut.

### Fixed — Phase 3 residual long-tail

This batch closes the documented Phase-3 residual deferrals (`deferrals.md`) in a single pass; every change is gated so non-feature rendering stays byte-identical.

- **The `dir` HTML attribute maps to `direction`** (HTML §3.2.6.4, `rtl-fragment-reversal` narrowed) — `<div dir="rtl">` / `dir="ltr"` now set the computed `direction` (so the initial `text-align: start` right-aligns RTL content), via `BoxBuilder.ApplyDirAttribute` as a UA-origin presentational hint: applied after inheritance (overrides an inherited direction) but before author declarations (a CSS `direction` still wins); `dir="auto"` keeps the inherited direction (the bidi first-strong heuristic remains a residual). A CSS-wide `direction` declaration (`inherit`/`unset`/`initial`/`revert`/`revert-layer`) is resolved by the cascade — the `dir` hint steps aside for it — and the attribute value is whitespace-trimmed (`dir=" rtl "`). The deferral's remaining parts — UAX-9 fragment-level slice reversal and the margin-box base direction — are closed in the next entry. Documents without a `dir` attribute are byte-identical.
- **RTL paragraphs paint their per-run slices right-to-left** (UAX #9 L2, `rtl-fragment-reversal` CLOSED) — a right-to-left paragraph base direction (`direction: rtl` / `dir="rtl"`) had correct bidi levels and right-alignment but still walked the line's per-run slices in document (logical) order, so a multi-run line (e.g. an RTL paragraph with embedded LTR words or numbers, or font-fallback runs) painted left-to-right. `LineBuilder.Wrap` now threads the paragraph base direction into the slice-emission site (`EmitDrawableRange`) and, for an RTL base, reverses the per-run slice ORDER (each slice is level-homogeneous, so a flat reverse is L2 reordering at run granularity — the first logical run lands rightmost). The glyph order WITHIN each slice is left as HarfBuzz shaped it, and `TotalAdvance` (the order-independent sum) is unchanged, so wrap/fit decisions are identical and the painter — which walks slices left-to-right accumulating advance, with the line right-aligned — paints the correct visual order. The margin-box painter (`PageMarginBoxPainter`) now reads its content's own `direction` (was hardcoded LTR) so an RTL `@page` margin box / running element lays out right-to-left too. Deeper-than-single-embedding bidi nesting is the residual approximation. `LeftToRight` / `Auto` bases keep document order, so LTR output is byte-identical.
- **Mixed-script paragraphs shape per script** (UAX #24, `uax-24-script-detection` CLOSED) — `LineBuilder.Itemize` previously produced runs split only by bidi level + source style, so a same-direction script change (e.g. Latin + Han, both LTR) shared one HarfBuzz pass with the caller's single uniform script (the production caller hardcodes `Latn`) and mis-shaped the non-Latin part. A new UAX #24 script table (`NetPdf.Text.Bidi.UnicodeScripts`, sorted range lookup over the ~30 major scripts) now drives a script-change boundary in `Itemize`: each itemized run carries its ISO 15924 script tag, and `LineBuilder.Shape` shapes it with that script (`run.ScriptIso15924 ?? uniform`) so Arabic / Han / Hangul / Indic runs get their own OpenType feature set. `Common`/`Inherited` codepoints (digits, punctuation, spaces, combining marks) extend the surrounding run and a leading Common prefix adopts the following script (UAX #24 §5.1). A single-script paragraph whose content matches the caller's uniform script is byte-identical (no new boundaries; same script tag); the long tail of uncovered rare scripts degrades to the surrounding/uniform script (no worse than before).
- **`word-break: keep-all` keeps CJK runs together** (CSS Text §5.2 / UAX #14 LB30b, `word-break-keep-all-cjk` CLOSED) — `keep-all` previously behaved like `normal` (no break suppression) and a per-run `keep-all` ↔ `normal`/`break-all` mismatch threw `NotSupportedException` from `InlineLayouter.LayoutPerRun`. `LineBuilder.Wrap` now demotes the implicit inter-character soft-wrap opportunities between two East-Asian "letter units" (UAX #14 line-break classes ID / CJ / H2 / H3 / JL / JV / JT) from `Allowed` to `Prohibited`, so CJK text breaks only at spaces / explicit opportunities — applied uniformly or per source run (so a keep-all run mixed with others no longer throws; it flows through the per-run policy array). Latin / non-CJK content is byte-identical (the suppression only fires between CJK codepoints under keep-all).
- **`repeat(auto-fit, …)` collapses empty grid tracks** (CSS Grid L1 §7.2.3.1, `grid-auto-fit-collapse-empty-tracks-deferral` CLOSED) — `auto-fit` previously expanded IDENTICALLY to `auto-fill` (the empty-track collapse was approximated + flagged by `LAYOUT-GRID-AUTO-FIT-APPROXIMATED-001`). After placement, the sizing pass now collapses every auto-fit-derived track that holds no item: its base / growth-limit go to 0, it leaves the fr pool, and the gutters on either side merge (a collapse-aware free-space gutter count + a "gutter only between visible tracks" position pass). So `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(100px, 1fr))` with fewer items than the derived track count makes the FILLED tracks absorb the freed space (e.g. 2 items in a 4-track-deriving 400px grid → two 200px columns) where `auto-fill` would keep them narrow with trailing empty space — the canonical responsive-grid difference. Auto-fit tracks are tagged through `ExpandTrackList` → `TrackSizingInfo.IsAutoFitDerived`; the approximation diagnostic is retired (a regression test asserts it is no longer emitted). Non-auto-fit grids have no collapsible track, so they are byte-identical (the position pass is bit-identical when nothing collapses).
- **`grid-row/column: auto / <line>` no longer emits a spurious placement-approximated diagnostic** (CSS Grid L1 §8.5, `grid-reverse-auto-placement-deferral` closed) — an item with an auto start and a definite end line has an implicit span of 1 (a span > 1 requires a `span` keyword, which routes to auto/span placement), so it correctly occupies the single cell ending at that line (`start = end − 1`). The placement was already correct; the deferral's premise (that a `span` could reach the auto-start-definite-end branch and need the §8.5 backward search) was inaccurate, so the `LAYOUT-GRID-PLACEMENT-APPROXIMATED-001` warning it emitted for both the integer- and named-line-end cases was spurious and is removed. The warning still fires for genuinely-approximated placements (unresolved named lines, occurrence syntax). Verified by `F7_auto_start_definite_end_places_single_cell_without_a_diagnostic`.
- **Struck three grid pagination deferrals already resolved end-to-end** — `grid-wrapper-rollback-for-pre-dispatch-deferral` (F1 pre-dispatch row-fit, shipped at both outer + recursive sites), `grid-fragment-extent-emitted-rows-only-deferral` (F2 wrapper-resize to the emitted extent), and `grid-explicit-height-paginate-deferral` (F3 dual-input geometry/budget separation) — were documented `RESOLVED end-to-end` with named regression tests but still listed. Verified the `Cycle5c2a_F1_*` / `Cycle5c2b_F2_*` / `Cycle5c2d_*` / `Cycle5c3_*` suites pass, then removed the entries (their only residuals are already tracked under `recursive-block-continuation-consumed-extent-accounting-deferral` and `grid-fragment-plan-shared-sizing-deferral`). Docs-only.

- **`@page` margin boxes honor a declared `line-height`** (CSS Inline 3 §4.2, `margin-box-line-height` closed) — literal margin-box content (e.g. `@bottom-center { content: "…"; line-height: 2 }`) previously used `font-size × 1.2` for its line pitch regardless of a declared `line-height`. `line-height` now joins `MarginBoxStyle`'s inherited longhand whitelist (so it flows root → `@page` context → margin box) and the painter reads it via `ReadLineHeightPx` (the full `<number>` / `<length>` / `<percentage>` grammar), falling back to `font-size × 1.2` only for `normal` / unset. A deferred font-/viewport-relative or `calc()` line-height (`2em` / `1.5rem` / `5vw` / `calc(1em + 4px)`) resolves at paint time against the content font / root / page box, **in place** so the inline-content line metrics see it too; and a declared `%` line-height is converted to a length at the declaring `@page`/box context's font-size before it inherits (so `@page { font-size:20px; line-height:200% }` gives a margin box a 40px length even at a smaller box font-size). A margin box with no declared `line-height` is byte-identical.
- **`text-align: match-parent` resolves against the parent at computed-value time** (CSS Text 3 §7.1, `text-align-match-parent` closed) — previously approximated as a fixed physical `left`, direction-insensitive. `BoxBuilder.ResolveMatchParentTextAlign` now replaces `match-parent` with the PARENT's `text-align`, resolving the parent's `start`/`end` to physical `left`/`right` against the PARENT's `direction`, during the top-down walk. So a child of a `direction: rtl; text-align: start` parent right-aligns (the parent's start-in-rtl) even when the child itself is `ltr`, and the resolved physical value inherits to descendants. The layout-time reader's `match-parent` branch is now a defensive fallback. Documents without `text-align: match-parent` are byte-identical.
- **Percentage `line-height` inherits as a length computed at the declaring element** (CSS Inline 3 §4.2, `line-height-percentage-inheritance` closed) — a `<percentage>` `line-height` (e.g. `line-height: 150%`) is now resolved to a length (% × the DECLARING element's font-size) in the top-down box-builder walk, before it inherits, so a child with a different font-size keeps the parent's computed length instead of re-resolving the percentage against its own font-size. `BoxBuilder.ResolveDeclaredPercentLineHeightInPlace` converts a declared `Percentage` line-height slot to `LengthPx`; `<number>` (inherits as the number) and `em`/`rem` (folded by `DeferredLengthResolver`) are untouched. The declaring element and same-font-size descendants are byte-identical (same used px, resolved earlier); only inheritance across a font-size change changes (to be correct).
- **`white-space: break-spaces` breaks after every preserved space** (CSS Text L3 §6.4, `white-space-break-spaces` closed) — previously treated identically to `pre-wrap` (wrap only at UAX #14 Allowed positions). The `LineBuilder` flat-build now upgrades each preserved SP/TAB glyph in a `break-spaces` source run to a `Allowed` break-after, so the wrap pass can break between consecutive spaces (not just after the whole space sequence); preserve-mode spaces are never trimmed, so trailing `break-spaces` spaces keep their advance and wrap rather than hang. Gated to `break-spaces` runs → all other white-space modes are byte-identical.

### Fixed — Phase 3 closeout (remaining residual deferrals)

- **Auto-height block backgrounds span their in-flow children** (CSS 2.1 §10.6.3, `auto-height-emit-vs-pagination` closed) — an `auto`-height block-flow container previously emitted only its own chrome (padding + border) as the painted border box, so its background / border / border-radius under-sized when its children were taller. The emitted fragment now spans the content extent (the value already used for the cursor + break accounting), **capped to the page fragment** so a subtree taller than the page paints a page-bounded rectangle — the cap is what keeps multi-page block-flow pagination byte-identical (the earlier uncapped attempt force-overflowed). Pagination, the cursor advance, the break checks, and continuation accounting are unchanged; only the painter's rectangle grows. **CSS 2.2 conformance → 100%** (30/30).
- **A single paragraph taller than a page splits its own lines across pages** (CSS Fragmentation L3 §4, `inline-only-block-line-splitting` narrowed) — a tall inline-only (text-bearing) block previously force-overflowed the page it started on; it now SLICES its wrapped lines across pages. The lines that fit emit on the current page; the remainder resumes via a new `InlineOnlyLineSplitContinuation` (carried in `BlockContinuation.LayouterState`, the grid/multicol resume pattern) — the painter walks `InlineLayout.Lines` by array index, so a page-fragment is the original `Lines[]` sliced to the fitting lines + a fresh block offset (no shaped-run buffers cross the page boundary; the resume page re-runs the deterministic inline pass + re-slices). **orphans / widows** are honored at the cut, read off the paragraph's OWN computed value (per-paragraph). Text-only, chrome-free blocks split; a tall single block with block-axis padding/border or inline atomics still falls back to whole-block force-overflow (the narrowed residual). Non-splitting prose rendering is byte-identical.
- **Multi-page allocation churn dropped from O(n²) to ~O(1)/page** (`multi-page-allocation-churn` closed, exit criterion 8 allocation linearity now met) — a table that fragments across N pages was re-shaped (column split + every cell) ONCE PER PAGE by the subtree-extent pass (a transient `TableLayouter` with no continuation), so per-page transient allocation grew ~O(n) with page count (≈ O(n²) total: 28 → 192 MiB/page over 5 → 39 pages). A new cross-page `TableMeasurementCache` (threaded through `LayoutContext` like `GridMeasureCache`) holds the page-invariant column layout keyed by the table box + content inline size, so the table is fully measured ONCE per conversion and reused by every page (and the first page's dispatch). Per-page allocation is now flat (~5 MiB/page; total at 39 pages dropped ~33×), enforced by a new allocation-slope gate. The cached state is the same deterministic, page-invariant data the cross-page `TableContinuation` already reused, so output is byte-identical (LayoutSnapshots / PaginationGolden / RealDocuments / AOT sha256 unchanged).

### Added — Phase 4 visual parity: shadows + 2D transforms

- **`box-shadow`** (outset) now paints UNDER the background (CSS B&B §7.2): a sharp (blur ≈ 0) layer is a native filled (rounded) rect offset + spread-expanded from the border box (corner radii grown by the spread); a blurred layer rasters through a new Skia bridge (`ShadowRasterizer` — draws the rounded-rect shape, applies a Gaussian blur with σ = blur/2, and places it as an image XObject with an alpha `/SMask`) at 2× resolution, capped at 4096 px/side, emitting `CSS-BOXSHADOW-BLUR-RASTER-001`. Multi-layer lists paint in reverse so the first-listed sits on top. `inset` shadows + unresolvable units (px + absolute units supported; em/rem/% not) are skipped with `CSS-BOXSHADOW-UNSUPPORTED-001` — outset-only first cut.
- **`text-shadow`** draws the shaped glyph run offset in the shadow color UNDER the main text (no re-shaping — the shadow reuses the run's glyph ids). A non-zero blur is painted as a sharp offset (the Gaussian glyph-blur raster is a tracked follow-up) flagged by `CSS-TEXTSHADOW-UNSUPPORTED-001`, which also covers unsupported units. Collected as the box's OWN declared value (inheritance to descendant text is a documented residual).
- **2D `transform`** (`translate`/`scale`/`rotate`/`skew`/`matrix` + axis variants) wraps a box's whole painting — decoration AND text — in a PDF `cm` about `transform-origin` (default 50% 50%), composing the CSS transform with the y-flip so the origin stays fixed and rotation reads correctly. 3D functions flatten to 2D (`translate3d`/`scale3d` keep their 2D part; the rest project to identity) with `CSS-TRANSFORM-3D-UNSUPPORTED-001`; an unparseable value paints untransformed with `CSS-TRANSFORM-UNSUPPORTED-001`. `transform` / `transform-origin` (dropped by AngleSharp.Css) are recovered via `CssPreprocessor`.
- All three are gated — non-shadow / non-transform rendering is byte-identical. Deferred (documented in `deferrals.md`): inset box-shadow, text-shadow inheritance + true glyph blur, faithful 3D-projection + the transformed-element stacking context.

### Added — Phase 4 visual parity: native PDF gradients

- **`background-image: linear-gradient(...)`** now paints as a PDF native axial shading (ISO 32000-2 ShadingType 2) instead of being skipped: a greenfield shading foundation (`PdfDocument.RegisterAxialShading` + a Type-2 / Type-3-stitching color function + `PdfPage.PaintShadingInRect` clip-and-`sh`), a `linear-gradient()` parser (default `to bottom`, `to <side>`/`<corner>`, `<angle>` in deg/grad/rad/turn, percentage stops, function colors), and the painter axis math (CSS Images §3.1 gradient line). Border-radius clips the gradient. A `to <corner>` direction is aspect-ratio correct (the angle is derived from the painted box, not a fixed 45°).
- **`background-image: radial-gradient(...)`** paints as a PDF native radial shading (ShadingType 3), reusing the foundation: shape (`circle`/`ellipse`), the four extent keywords, and `at <position>` (center / sides / percentages, order-independent keyword pairs; a duplicate-axis or misordered position is rejected). FIRST CUT: the ending shape is painted circularly (an `ellipse` is approximated by its scalar extent — exact for a centered gradient on a square box).
- Both are gated — non-gradient rendering is byte-identical. Repeated identical gradients share one color function (and, when coincident, one shading object). A multi-layer background list is rejected (single-function-token guard). Deferred (documented): `box-shadow`, elliptical radial shaping via CTM, `repeating-*` / conic gradients, length-positioned stops, per-stop alpha (soft-mask), gradient `background-clip`/`-origin` insets.

### Fixed — CSS sizing residuals (conformance raised past the `0.7.0-beta` baseline)

- **Grid `fr` tracks subtract the gutters from their distributed free space** (CSS Grid L1 §7.2.3/§11.5) — `grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; column-gap: 20px` in a 400px container now sizes each fr track at 190 (= (400-20)/2), not 200; percentage tracks still resolve against the full content area. Grid conformance → **100%** (15/15).
- **Percentage `min-width` / `max-width` / `min-height` / `max-height` resolve against the containing block** (CSS 2.1 §10.4/§10.7), box-sizing-aware, with the indefinite-axis rule (a `%` max against an indefinite base → `none`, a `%` min → `0`). CSS 2.2 conformance → **96.7%** (29/30).
- **Percentage `column-gap` / `row-gap` resolve against the container content box** (CSS Box Alignment L3 §8.3) — the properties are now `<length-percentage>` (column-gap → inline size, row-gap → block size), on flex AND grid containers.

### Added — Flexbox L1 completion (`flex-layouter-features`)

- **`align-items: baseline` / `align-self: baseline`** (CSS Flexbox L1 §8.3 + CSS Box Alignment L3 §6.2) — the three `<baseline-position>` keywords now perform real first-baseline alignment on a ROW container's cross axis (each item is shifted so its first text baseline sits on the line's max baseline; an item with no line box synthesizes its baseline from its cross-end edge per §8.5). Previously they decoded to `stretch`. COLUMN baseline falls back to flex-start (no first baseline on the inline axis without vertical text).
- **`flex-basis: content` / `max-content` / `min-content`** (CSS Flexbox L1 §7.2 + §9.2.3) — intrinsic flex base sizing on the nowrap ROW main axis: the item is measured to its max-content (no wrap pressure) or min-content (maximal wrap pressure) inline extent, fed through the §9.7 flexibility resolution. The keyword (which AngleSharp.Css drops) is recovered through `CssPreprocessor`; the FlexLayouter emission and the BlockLayouter row-flex pre-measure build the base sizes via one shared helper so they stay in lockstep. WRAP rows + `fit-content` remain deferred.
- The `flex` shorthand (§7.4) was already shipped (`FlexShorthandExpander`); a flex-item-level integration test now pins `flex: 1` → grow 1 / shrink 1 / basis 0 end-to-end.

[Unreleased]: https://github.com/raroche/NetPdf/compare/0.7.0-beta...HEAD

## [0.7.0-beta] — staged for 2026-06-21 (tag pending PR merge)

Phase 3 — fragmentainer-aware layout + pagination. NetPdf now runs an HTML+CSS document **end-to-end to a multi-page PDF**: the Phase-2 box tree flows through block / inline / flex / grid / table / multicol / absolute layout, a pagination optimizer chooses the page breaks, paged media (`@page` + the 16 margin boxes + generated content) frames each page, and text shaping + painting + image embedding (Phase-5-interleaved) write the bytes. This is the first user-useful release — most business documents render correctly. The repository remains **private through Phase 5**; this is a git-tag-only milestone (no NuGet publication — that lands at v1.0).

### Added

#### Layout engine (`NetPdf.Layout`)
- **Block formatting** — margin collapsing, block formatting contexts, floats + `clear`, min/max/fit-content sizing, `box-sizing: content-box|border-box` on **both** axes (via the shared `BoxSizingHelper`), `LengthPx` min/max-width/height clamping (explicit + auto/fill), and §10.3.3 auto-margin centering (`margin: 0 auto`) — block, list-item, replaced, **and** flex/grid containers.
- **Inline + line layout** (`LineBuilder`) — UAX #9 bidi, HarfBuzz shaping, UAX #14 line breaking, `white-space`, `text-align` (incl. `justify` / `justify-all`), the full `vertical-align` set (incl. line-edge keyword line growth), the `line-height` cascade grammar, inline-block baseline metrics, `::first-line` / `::first-letter`.
- **Flexbox L1** — W3C subset **100%**: all four `flex-direction` values + `flex-wrap` (incl. `wrap-reverse`), `justify-content` / `align-items` / `align-self` / `align-content` (positional + safe/unsafe overflow), `flex-grow` / `flex-shrink` / `flex-basis` (length + auto) with the §9.7 step-4 min/max clamping iteration, `order`, `gap` / `column-gap` / `row-gap` gutters (consuming free space before grow/shrink + justify-content), explicit container `width` + `margin: 0 auto` centering, RTL `row` main-axis flip, anonymous-item wrapping, and multi-page container splitting.
- **CSS Grid L1** — W3C subset **93.3%**: track sizing (`auto` / `fr` / `minmax` / `fit-content` / `repeat` / `auto-fill` / `auto-fit`), sparse + dense auto-placement, `grid-template-areas`, `column-gap` / `row-gap` / `gap` gutters (incl. spanned items + auto-height extent), and cross-page row splitting with a row-extent memo.
- **Tables** — auto + fixed layout, collapse/separate borders, row/colspan, `<thead>`/`<tfoot>` repeat, intra-cell row splitting across pages. **Multicol**, **absolute** + `position: fixed`.

#### Pagination engine (`NetPdf.Paginate`)
- Break resolver, a documented cost model, a bounded-DP optimizer (≤2-page lookahead), continuation tokens, checkpoint/rewind, and a bounded-retry coordinator. Prose paginates at block granularity (a text block whose margin box overflows breaks whole to the next page).

#### Multi-page driver
- The page-emitting driver loop with nested-container fragmentation, per-page counters, cross-page running content, per-page `@page :first` / `:left` / `:right` / `:blank`, named pages, and font de-duplication across pages.

#### Paged media + generated content
- `@page` rules + the 16 margin boxes (style / border / padding / background / border-radius / overflow), `string()` / `string-set` (incl. the `content()` form), `element()` / `position: running()`, and `counter(page)` / `counter(pages)` with counter styles.

#### Paint + PDF emission (Phase-5-interleaved)
- `TextPainter` (shape → subset → embed), `FragmentPainter` (background-color/-image, borders, outline, border-radius, tiling patterns), the image pipeline (`<img>` + `background-*`, `object-fit` / `-position`, `data:` URIs, Skia raster fallback), all writing through **our** PDF byte writer (`NetPdf.Pdf`).

#### W3C conformance suite (`tests/NetPdf.W3cConformance`)
- A **curated assertion suite** (not vendored WPT) that drives the internal pipeline (`Phase2Pipeline` → `BlockLayouter`) and asserts `BoxFragment` geometry, gated per-case (every non-`KnownGap` case must pass; every `KnownGap` case must still fail). Published pass-rates: **CSS 2.2 93.3%** (28/30), **Fragmentation 90.0%** (9/10), **Flexbox 100%** (18/18), **Grid 93.3%** (14/15).

#### Performance + memory gates
- `PerformanceGateTests` enforce a 3-page invoice (~42 ms) + a 22-page report (~400 ms) on the synthetic-font layout pipeline, and a retained-heap gate (flat across page count).

### Test counts

- **7,157 unit tests** (+3 skipped), 30 layout snapshots, 97 real-document goldens, 4 W3C conformance gates, pagination golden, rendering corpus, PDF validation, AOT/JIT byte-parity, and determinism — all green at **0 warnings** in Release.

### Notes / known limitations

- **Perf + memory exit criteria are smoke-gated / partial, not fully met.** The perf gate exercises a synthetic-font layout pipeline (no images / web fonts); the full-pipeline BenchmarkDotNet target is not yet a build gate. Retained heap is flat, but allocation scaling across pages is super-linear (`multi-page-allocation-churn`).
- **Documented deferrals** (none block a conformance criterion): auto-height shrink-to-fit of the emitted box (`auto-height-emit-vs-pagination`), percentage min/max sizing (`min-max-percentage-sizing`), grid `fr` tracks + gap (`grid-gap-fr-track-sizing`), percentage gaps (`gap-percentage-sizing`), and single-paragraph line splitting (`inline-only-block-line-splitting`). Full inventory: `docs/deferrals.md`.
- **Tagged PDF / PDF/UA / PDF/A are post-v1.** The semantic IR is built alongside layout but tagged structure is not emitted in v1.

## [0.3.0-alpha] — staged for 2026-05-07 (tag pending PR merge)

Phase 2 — CSS engine + DOM pipeline. NetPdf can now run an HTML+CSS document through the full Phase 2 pipeline (parse → preprocess → cascade → var → calc → typed-property resolve → box-tree generation → semantic-tree generation) and produce a styled, paginatable box tree paired with an accessibility-ready semantic tree. The PDF byte-writer from Phase 1 remains intact; the missing piece between "HTML in" and "PDF bytes out" is Phase 3 (layout + pagination) + Phase 4 (paint).

### Added

#### HTML parsing host (`NetPdf/HtmlParsingHost`)
- AngleSharp 1.x configured with scripting **disabled** + resource loading routed through `IResourceLoader` (no AngleSharp resource fetcher leakage). `IsKeepingSourceReferences = true` so HTML diagnostics carry line/column.
- `<script>` element stripping with `HTML-SCRIPT-IGNORED-001` Warning per element.
- `javascript:` URL stripping on `<a>`/`<area>` `href` + any element's `xlink:href` with `HTML-JAVASCRIPT-URL-IGNORED-001` Warning.
- HTML diagnostics flow through the public `IDiagnosticsSink` set on `HtmlPdfOptions.Diagnostics`.

#### CSS parser adapter (`NetPdf.Css.Parser`)
- AngleSharp.Css 1.0.0-beta.144 bridged to the internal AST. `CssParserAdapter` produces `CssStylesheet` records carrying selectors, declarations, source location, media query, owner-element pairing, and disabled state.
- `CssPreprocessor` recovery layer: detects + restores authored text for modern functions/values that AngleSharp.Css 1.0.0-beta.144 silently corrupts or drops (`oklch()`, `oklab()`, `lab()`, `lch()`, `color()`, `color-mix()`, `light-dark()`, modern multi-arg `attr(name type, fallback)`).
- Owner-node-based stylesheet pairing (`<style media="...">` reads media via owner-element walk, not via fragile ordinal pairing).

#### Source-generated property tables (`NetPdf.SourceGen`)
- `PropertyId` enum + `PropertyMetadata.Table` + `PropertyMetadata.NameToId` (`FrozenDictionary` for case-insensitive O(1) lookup) generated at compile-time from `properties.json`. **Single source of truth** — adding a CSS property is a JSON entry + rebuild.
- Source-gen emits NPDFGEN0001..0005 diagnostics on schema violations (missing field, duplicate id, malformed value).

#### `ComputedStyle` (`NetPdf.Css.ComputedValues`)
- 8-byte `ComputedSlot` value type with a tag in the high byte: `Unset`, `Color`, `CurrentColor`, `LengthPx`, `Integer`, `Number`, `Percent`, `Keyword`, `Inherit`, `Initial`, `Revert`, `Side`. Larger values (font-family lists, gradients) keyed by index into rented side tables.
- `ComputedStyle` is a `sealed class` (NOT a struct) holding two `[InlineArray]`-backed inline buffers — one of `ComputedSlot`s sized to `PropertyMetadata.Count`, one of `ulong` bitmap words for the explicit-set flag. Pooled via a process-wide `ConcurrentBag<ComputedStyle>` (NOT `ArrayPool<T>`); `Rent()` clears via `Reset()` on take, `Dispose()` returns to the bag with a soft-guard `_disposed` flag.
- Custom properties (`--*`) live in a lazily-allocated `Dictionary<string, ComputedSlot>` on `ComputedStyle`; var() substitution reads through.

#### Selector compiler + matcher (`NetPdf.Css.Selectors`)
- AngleSharp selector AST → bytecode-style compiled selectors with right-to-left evaluation.
- Bloom filter on each element's `(tag, classList, id)` accelerates rejection. Specificity computed at compile time.
- Compound selectors, descendant / child / sibling combinators, attribute selectors, `:hover` / `:focus` / `:checked` / `:nth-child(...)` / `:has(...)` / `:not(...)`. `::before` / `::after` / `::marker` / `::first-line` / `::first-letter` produce pseudo-element selectors with separated rule storage.

#### Cascade resolver (`NetPdf.Css.Cascade`)
- Specificity / origin / importance / `@layer` ordering + source-order tie-breaking per CSS Cascade L4. UA → User → Author per origin priority.
- `@layer` ordering with proper later-layer-wins semantics.
- `:has()` selector parsed + bytecode-flagged; the matcher **always returns false** at runtime in v1 + emits `CSS-HAS-RENDERING-NOT-IMPLEMENTED-001` once per flagged sub-group encountered (deferred to v1.4 when proper `:has()` matching lands).
- `@container` parsed; rendering emits `CSS-CONTAINER-QUERY-UNSUPPORTED-001` (Roadmap v1.4).

#### `var()` substitution (`NetPdf.Css.ComputedValues.VarResolver`)
- Custom property substitution with circular-reference detection (`CSS-VAR-CIRCULAR-001`) + expansion limit (`CSS-VAR-EXPANSION-LIMIT-001`).
- Fallback chains (`var(--x, var(--y, 12px))`).

#### `calc` resolver (`NetPdf.Css.Cascade.CalcResolver`)
- Recognizes `calc()` / `min()` / `max()` / `clamp()` / `abs()` / `sign()` per CSS Values L4 §10. **Subset contract** — fully reduces expressions whose operands are absolute lengths (px, in, cm, mm, q, pt, pc), percentages, angles (deg/rad/grad/turn), times (ms/s), frequencies (hz/khz), or resolutions (dppx/x/dpi/dpcm). Context-relative operands (font-relative `em`/`rem`/`ch`/`ex`/`ic`/`cap`/`lh`/`rlh`; viewport-relative `vw`/`vh`/`vmin`/`vmax` + small/large/dynamic variants; container-relative `cqw`/`cqh`/`cqi`/`cqb`/`cqmin`/`cqmax`) **defer**: the original function text is preserved verbatim for the typed-value pipeline (Tasks 10+) or Phase 3 layout to revisit once font matching + viewport size + container queries are known. Mixed-unit operations across incompatible dimensions also defer.
- Division-by-zero detection emits `CSS-CALC-DIV-BY-ZERO-001`.
- Syntactically broken expressions (trailing tokens, malformed clamp arity, etc.) emit `CSS-CALC-INVALID-001`.

#### Per-property typed resolvers (`NetPdf.Css.ComputedValues.PropertyResolvers`)
- **Length resolver** — absolute lengths fully resolve to pixels (px, in, cm, mm, q, pt, pc) plus percentages. **Context-relative units defer** to Phase 3's typed-value pipeline once font metrics + viewport + container size are known: font-relative (`em`/`rem`/`ch`/`ex`/`ic`/`cap`/`lh`/`rlh`), viewport-relative (`vw`/`vh`/`vmin`/`vmax` + `svw`/`lvw`/`dvw` variants + `vi`/`vb`), container-relative (`cqw`/`cqh`/`cqi`/`cqb`/`cqmin`/`cqmax`). The deferred raw text is preserved on the cascade entry for the typed pipeline to consume.
- **Color resolver** — 147 named colors per Color L4 §6.1, 20 system colors per §10, hex notation, `rgb()`/`rgba()` legacy + modern, `hsl()`/`hsla()` legacy + modern with strict syntax per Color L4 §4.2.1/§4.3.1, `currentcolor` sentinel.
- Number, Integer, Keyword resolvers (per-property keyword tables generated from `properties.json`).
- Modern color functions (`oklch`, `oklab`, `lab`, `lch`, `color`, `color-mix`, `light-dark`) parsed via preprocessor recovery; cycle-1 emits `CSS-MODERN-COLOR-FUNCTION-UNSUPPORTED-001` Info; typed evaluation lands cycle-2.
- `font-weight` resolved to numbers per Color L4 § 4.

#### `Box` hierarchy + `BoxKind` enum (`NetPdf.Layout.Boxes`)
- Typed enum: `Root`, `BlockContainer`, `InlineBox`, `InlineReplacedElement`, `ListItem`, `Marker`, `AnonymousBlock`, `TextRun`, `LineBreak`, `Table`, `TableGrid`, `TableHeaderGroup`, `TableRowGroup`, `TableFooterGroup`, `TableRow`, `TableColumn`, `TableColumnGroup`, `TableCell`, `TableHeaderCell`, `TableCaption`, `InlineBlockContainer`. `Box` carries `SourceElement?`, `Pseudo`, `Style`, `Children`, optional `FirstLineStyle` / `FirstLetterStyle` (Phase 3 line layout consumes).

#### `BoxBuilder` (`NetPdf.Layout.Boxes.BoxBuilder`)
- DOM walk + display dispatch + anonymous-block insertion per CSS Display L3 §3.
- `HtmlDefaultDisplay` UA defaults table per HTML "Rendering" §15.3 (incl. metadata-content `display: none`); `HtmlReplacedElements` covers img/video/audio/canvas/iframe/object/embed.
- `DisplayMapper` produces `(BoxKind, ResolutionOutcome)` from `(display, element)`. Replaced-element exception per Tables L3 §2.
- Anonymous block insertion per Display L3 §3.1 (block containers with mixed inline + block children).
- `display: contents` per Display L3 §3.1.1 (children promoted to grandparent).
- Table fixup per Tables L3 §3 (single `TableGrid` child + auto-wrapping bare cells/rows in synthesized row-groups + caption position preservation + column child filtering + tree-wide orphan fixup + replaced-element exception + anon-box style isolation).
- Pseudo-element materialization per CSS Pseudo L4: `::before` / `::after` with `content: ` parsing (string + multi-string concat + `attr(name)` substitution + escape decoding); `::marker` per Lists L3 §3 with 12 `list-style-type` keywords (disc, circle, square, decimal, decimal-leading-zero, lower/upper-roman, lower/upper-alpha, lower/upper-latin, lower-greek); `::first-line` / `::first-letter` style staging on the host box for Phase 3 line layout to apply during fragment rendering.
- Replaced-element pseudo suppression per Pseudo L4 §3 with diagnostic dedup.

#### `SemanticTreeBuilder` (`NetPdf.Layout.Semantic`)
- Parallel walk producing 26 PDF/UA-aligned roles (Document, Heading1..6, Paragraph, BlockQuote, Code, List, ListItem, Table family, Link, Image, Figure, FigureCaption, Header / Footer / Nav / Main / Aside / Article / Section, InlineText).
- Cascade-aware hidden-element exclusion (`display: none`, `visibility: hidden`, ARIA `aria-hidden="true"`, HTML5 `hidden`, metadata-content tags).
- Image alt tri-state per HTML5 §4.8.3 (`null` for missing, empty string for explicit `alt=""` decorative, normalized non-empty for explicit alt; aria-label fallback).
- Table-cell metadata captured (rowspan, colspan, scope, headers, abbr) per HTML5 §4.9.10 + §4.9.12.
- `<a>` without `href` is transparent per HTML5 §4.6.1.
- `<pre>` / `<code>` preserve descendant text whitespace per HTML5 §15.3.5.
- v1 policy on generated content: `::before` / `::after` / `::marker` text intentionally absent (DOM-only walk; box-tree-driven rebuild for v1.1 PDF/UA).

#### Diagnostics (`docs/diagnostics-codes.md`)
- 18 new CSS-* + HTML-* codes registered (CSS-PROPERTY-VALUE-INVALID-001, CSS-PARSE-WARNING-001, CSS-AT-RULE-UNKNOWN-001, CSS-VAR-CIRCULAR-001, CSS-VAR-EXPANSION-LIMIT-001, CSS-CALC-INVALID-001, CSS-CALC-DIV-BY-ZERO-001, CSS-CONTAINER-QUERY-UNSUPPORTED-001, CSS-HAS-RENDERING-NOT-IMPLEMENTED-001, CSS-CONTENT-FUNCTION-UNSUPPORTED-001, CSS-ATTR-MULTI-ARG-UNSUPPORTED-001, CSS-MODERN-COLOR-FUNCTION-UNSUPPORTED-001, CSS-PSEUDO-SUPPRESSED-ON-REPLACED-001, HTML-SCRIPT-IGNORED-001, HTML-JAVASCRIPT-URL-IGNORED-001).
- Internal `CssDiagnostic` mirrored to public `Diagnostic` via `PublicDiagnosticsSinkAdapter`. A single sink set on `HtmlPdfOptions.Diagnostics` collects HTML + CSS + layout diagnostics.

#### `Phase2Pipeline` (`NetPdf/Phase2/Phase2Pipeline`)
- Canonical pipeline composition: `RunFromHtmlAsync(html, options, sink, ct)` + `Run(document, sheets, options, sink, ct)`. Returns `Phase2Result(BoxRoot, SemanticRoot, ResolvedCascade, AdaptedSheets)`.
- `CancellationToken` honored at every stage boundary.
- `CssMediaContext` built from `HtmlPdfOptions` (MediaType + PageSize → media query evaluation + viewport).

#### Layout snapshot test infrastructure (`tests/NetPdf.LayoutSnapshots`)
- 9 fixture pairs covering principal Phase 2 surface area: simple paragraph, ordered list with markers, table with caption + scope + colspan, var/calc value chain (with paired computed-value Fact), pseudo-element with attr() substitution, hidden + aria filtering, figure + image alt tri-state, unsupported CSS features (counter() + oklch() + img::before — 3 distinct codes), `<script>` + `javascript:` URL stripping (HTML diagnostics with source location).
- 3 deterministic serializers: `BoxTreeSerializer`, `SemanticTreeSerializer`, `DiagnosticsSerializer`. Auto-discovered fixture directories.
- `NETPDF_UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1` regenerates goldens.
- Source-tree path resolution walks up to `NetPdf.slnx` so updates write to source, not `bin/`.

#### Phase 2 pipeline benchmark (`tests/NetPdf.Benchmarks/Phase2PipelineBenchmarks`)
- 5 benchmarks: 4 corpus invoices (3.7–13.6 KB) + 100 KB synthetic invoice (Phase 2 exit-criterion gate).
- First-cycle baseline (Apple M4 Pro, .NET 10.0.7, macOS arm64, in-process toolchain). Statistics are extracted from BenchmarkDotNet's `*-report-full-compressed.json` so p50 / p25 / p75 are explicit:
  - 01-classic-pure-css.html (3.7 KB): mean **561 µs**, 1.43 MB allocated.
  - 02-tailwind-cdn.html (10.8 KB): mean **547 µs**, 1.34 MB.
  - 03-tailwind-cdn-responsive.html (13.6 KB): mean **702 µs**, 1.61 MB.
  - 04-anvil-running-elements.html (6.3 KB): mean **717 µs**, 1.58 MB.
  - 100 KB synthetic invoice: **mean 51.6 ms / p50 51.4 ms / p25 51.3 ms / p75 51.9 ms / 51.3 MB**.
- **Phase 2 exit-criterion #7 (`< 50 ms p50` for 100 KB invoice) is documented as borderline-waived for the `0.3.0-alpha` ship**, not satisfied: the measured p50 is 51.4 ms, ~2.8% over target. The waiver rationale is documented in the benchmark's XML doc + the Phase 2 doc's exit-criterion checkbox: cycle-1 prioritizes correctness over perf; the 100 KB synthetic stresses cascade-matching at ~3700 elements which is an O(rules × elements) hot path; Phase 3 layout/paint will dominate total convert wall-clock anyway (Phase 2 pipeline becomes ~1% once fragmentainer-aware layout lands), so deferring the optimization until Phase 3+5 lets us use rendering-bound measurements instead of synthetic-bound ones to set the perf budget. The benchmark + JSON capture stay green for Phase 5 to pin once the full convert path is wired.

### Test counts
- **3220 unit tests** + 96 RealDocuments + 30 LayoutSnapshots = **3346 tests passing** (1 skipped pin-capture utility).
- AOT/JIT byte-parity gate from Phase 1 remains green.

### Notes / known limitations
- `HtmlPdf.Convert(html)` still throws `NotImplementedException`. Phase 2 produces the styled box tree; Phase 3 wires layout/pagination, Phase 4 wires paint, then the public facade returns real PDF bytes.
- External `<link rel="stylesheet">` resource loading is disabled at the AngleSharp boundary in v0.3.x; Phase 5 wires the resource pipeline.
- Modern color functions (`oklch`/`oklab`/`lab`/`lch`/`color`/`color-mix`/`light-dark`) parse via preprocessor recovery + emit `CSS-MODERN-COLOR-FUNCTION-UNSUPPORTED-001`; typed evaluation lands cycle-2.
- `::before`/`::after`/`::marker` generated text is materialized in the box tree but intentionally absent from the semantic tree per the v1 PDF/UA policy. v1.1 PDF/UA pass re-sources the semantic tree from the rendered box tree.
- AngleSharp.Css 1.0.0-beta.144 silently drops `display: contents` + `::marker` selectors during parse. Implementations are correct + load-bearing once cycle 2 wires preprocessor recovery for these.
- CSS source positions (line/column) are wired through plumbing but emit `CssSourceLocation.Unknown` until Task 3 cycle-2 lands real source tracking.

## [0.1.0-alpha] — 2026-05-03

Phase 1 — PDF writer + text foundation. NetPdf can now produce well-formed, byte-deterministic PDF 1.7 bytes programmatically from internal `PdfDocument` calls (no HTML pipeline yet — that ships in Phase 2). The PDF byte writer, the international text shaping subsystem (UAX #9 / #14 / #29 conformance), the OpenType font subsetting + ToUnicode CMap pipeline, the WOFF 1.0 / 2.0 decoders, the JPEG / PNG / WebP / AVIF / GIF image embedders with content-hash dedup and indirect `/SMask` wiring, the determinism harness with a per-platform pin map, the AOT-clean smoke binary with an enforced JIT/AOT byte-parity gate, and the BenchmarkDotNet baseline with a +25%-tolerance regression gate are all in place.

### Added

#### PDF byte writer (`NetPdf.Pdf`)
- Full `PdfObject` hierarchy: 11 concrete types (Boolean, Null, Integer, Real, Name, LiteralString, HexString, Array, Dictionary, Stream, IndirectRef) emitting bytes per ISO 32000-2:2020 §7.3. `PdfDictionary` uses `OrderedDictionary<TKey,TValue>` for deterministic insertion-order preservation.
- `IndirectObjectStore` with 1-based deterministic numbering, `Allocate` / `Add` / `Assign` / forward references, byte-offset recording, and `ValidateAllAssigned` gate.
- `PdfDocumentWriter` orchestrating header → indirect objects → xref → trailer → `startxref` → `%%EOF`. xref entries exactly 20 bytes (§7.5.4); 4-byte binary marker comment (§7.5.2); `MaxXrefByteOffset = 9_999_999_999` enforced (4 boundary unit tests cover the throw).
- Auto-derived trailer `/ID` from SHA-256 of header + indirect objects + xref (§14.4) — content-addressing for free.
- `PdfPreflightValidator` runs structural checks before any byte is written: version on allow-list, all slots assigned, `/Root` shape, explicit `/ID` shape, foreign-store reference rejection, direct-cycle + indirect-cycle detection, no nested direct streams (streams must be indirect per §7.3.8).
- `ContentStreamWriter` with `q` / `Q` / `cm` / `re` / `f` / `S` / `Tj` / `TJ` / `Do` / BMC / BDC / EMC operators; `ContentStreamBuilder` facade with optional FlateDecode compression at the centrally-pinned `PdfFormat.PdfDeflateCompressionLevel = SmallestSize`.
- `DisplayCommand` 64-byte tagged-union IR + `DisplayList` buffer (Phase 2/3 paint output).

#### Font subsetter & embedding
- `OpenTypeFont` parser covering `head` / `hhea` / `maxp` / `cmap` / `loca` / `glyf` / `name` / `OS/2` / `post` / `hmtx` (TTF) **and** `CFF` / `CFF2` headers (OTF). Read-only span-based; AOT-clean. **Parsing scope only** — see embedding scope immediately below.
- **TTF embedding pipeline (shipped):** glyph subsetter with composite-glyph closure traversal + `glyf`/`loca` re-numbering; new `cmap` formats 4 + 12 (BMP + supplementary planes); `ToUnicode` CMap generator with deterministic per-glyph mapping (preserves searchable/copyable text without requiring tagged PDF); Type 0 / CIDFontType2 wrapper with full `/FontFile2` + `/FontDescriptor` + `/DescendantFonts` graph; 6-letter deterministic `BaseFont` prefix (SHA-256 of name + glyph bitmap → first 6 hex digits → base-26).
- **OTF / CFF embedding — deferred to Phase 1.x.** `0.1.0-alpha` does NOT ship CFF subsetting or the `FontFile3` / `CIDFontType0C` emit path. `EmbeddedTtfFont.Build` throws `InvalidOperationException` with a clear "OTF/CFF embedding deferred" message when called on a CFF-flavored `OpenTypeFont` — consumers get a precise signal rather than a malformed PDF. CFF2 (variable-fonts) is post-v1.0 work.

#### Text shaping (`NetPdf.Text`)
- HarfBuzzSharp wrapper (`HbShaper.Shape`) producing glyph runs with kerning + ligature + script-aware shaping.
- **UAX #9 Bidi** — full implementation (P / X / W / N / I / L rules + BD7/BD13 segmentation). UCD `BidiTest.txt` + `BidiCharacterTest.txt` at **100% conformance**.
- **UAX #14 Line Breaking** — pair-table-driven LB rules. UCD `LineBreakTest.txt` at **99.952% conformance**.
- **UAX #29 Grapheme Cluster Boundaries** — UCD `GraphemeBreakTest.txt` at **100% conformance**. (Word and sentence boundaries — stages 14.2 / 14.3 — are post-Phase-1.)
- **Liang hyphenation** with English (`en-us`) bundled patterns + exceptions list. Span-based hot-path lookup via `FrozenDictionary.GetAlternateLookup<ReadOnlySpan<char>>`.
- **Font registry** + cross-platform system font enumeration (macOS, Windows, Linux, Alpine). Per-document `FontRegistry` with composite key `(Family, WeightCss, StretchCss, Italic)`. Spec-accurate CSS Fonts 4 §5.2 ordered tier search (stretch direction → style → weight regime).
- **WOFF 1.0** decoder (zlib) and **WOFF 2.0** decoder (Brotli + glyf/loca transform reverse via the 128-entry §5.2 triplet decode table). Real Roboto-Regular.woff2 fixture exercises the full pipeline.

#### Image embedding (`NetPdf.Pdf.Images`)
- **JPEG passthrough** — strict SOI → SOFn → SOS → EOI walk; only SOF0 / SOF2 + 8-bit accepted. Adobe-inverted CMYK detected and emitted with `/Decode [1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0]`. ICC profiles tolerated.
- **PNG embedder** with four paths: opaque passthrough (`Predictor 15`), color-key `/Mask` for binary tRNS, alpha-split SMask for RGBA / GA, indexed-with-non-binary-tRNS via SMask. CRC-32 + structural validation. Bounded zlib decompression for trust-boundary defense.
- **WebP / AVIF / GIF** via SkiaSharp decode → RGB plane + optional alpha plane → FlateDecode. 25-megapixel cap. AVIF fixture (BSD-2-Clause libavif test corpus) committed; tests no-op gracefully on hosts without libavif (macOS).
- **`PdfDocument.RegisterImage(ImageXObjectResult)`** wires the indirect `/SMask` reference correctly: clones the primary image dictionary before assigning so the caller's builder output stays immutable across registrations. Same-instance dedup works; cross-document reuse works.
- **Content-hash dedup** keys on payload + dictionary canonical bytes (SHA-256 of both). Two pixel-identical buffers with different `/ColorSpace` or `/Filter` remain distinct.

#### High-level `PdfDocument` builder
- `AddPage(MediaBoxSize)` / `RegisterImage(PdfStream | ImageXObjectResult)` / `Save()` / `SaveTo(IBufferWriter<byte>)` API. Single-use document model (throws on second `Save()`).
- Info dict metadata: Title / Author / Subject / Keywords / Creator / Producer / CreationDate / ModDate. ISO 32000-2 §7.9.4 date format `D:YYYYMMDDHHmmSS{Z|+HH'mm'|-HH'mm'}`. Defaults to omitted dates for reproducibility.
- Image XObject shape validation: `/Subtype /Image`, Width > 0, Height > 0, ColorSpace, BitsPerComponent ∈ {1,2,4,8,16} (and {8,16} for SMasks per §11.6).

#### Determinism harness
- 18 document shapes × 4 property tests (byte-equal-twice, byte-equal-thrice, structural sanity, per-platform SHA-256 pin) = **72 parameterized determinism tests**.
- Per-platform pin map keyed by `OS-arch` (`osx-arm64` pinned; other platforms log "no pin, snapshot skipped" until Phase 5 captures them in the containerized reference environment).
- `DeterminismDiagnostics.AssertByteEqualsWithDiagnostics` produces diagnosable failures: first-diff offset + per-half SHA + hex/ASCII context windows.
- Error-path determinism: `RegisterImage(invalid)` and double-`Save()` must throw the same exception type and the same `Message` across runs.
- Explicit `/ID` extraction test (`Canonical_document_has_deterministic_trailer_ID`).
- `PdfFormat.PdfDeflateCompressionLevel = SmallestSize` pins the deflate level so all stream emitters produce byte-equal output for byte-equal input.

#### AOT smoke + parity gate
- `tests/NetPdf.AotSmoke/` publishes a 1.5 MB native binary via `dotnet publish -p:PublishAot=true`. Exercises JPEG passthrough + transparent-GIF SMask path through `PdfDocument`.
- `SmokeDocumentFactory` shared between the AOT entry point and the parity test — drift between them is impossible.
- `tests/NetPdf.UnitTests/Pdf/AotJitParityTests.cs` (4 tests): asserts the native binary's SHA-256 output equals the JIT factory's. Negative-path verified — perturbing the JIT factory causes the parity test to fail with a diagnosable SHA mismatch.
- `scripts/aot-parity.sh` — single-command publish + parity-gate run for CI.

#### Performance baseline + regression gate
- 6 benchmark classes split per concern (PageScaling, SinglePage, ImageEmbedding, Dedup, Streaming, MixedDocument) → 23 parameterized benchmarks.
- `[MemoryDiagnoser]` on every benchmark; Workstation GC pinned for cross-host stability.
- Per-platform baseline JSONs committed under `tests/NetPdf.Benchmarks/baselines/phase-1-osx-arm64/`.
- `scripts/benchmark-gate.sh` — single-command gate. Runs the suite, exports JSON, invokes `Program.cs --compare BASELINE-DIR CURRENT-DIR [tolerance]`, exits 1 if any benchmark Mean exceeds +25% of baseline. Negative-path verified.
- Phase 1 baseline highlights (Apple M4 Pro, .NET 10.0.7, macOS arm64, Workstation GC):
  - Single blank A4 page → bytes: **5.6 µs**, 7.45 KB.
  - 1000 blank pages → bytes: **2.59 ms**, 2.6 MB (linear at ~2.46 KB/page across 4 orders of magnitude).
  - JPEG passthrough single page: **9.2 µs**.
  - PNG RGBA + indirect SMask: **19.1 µs**.
  - WebP opaque via raster: **19.0 µs**.
  - Cache-hit-isolated dedup per call: **2.9 µs** (true per-call cost via `[OperationsPerInvoke = 99]`).
  - `SaveTo(IBufferWriter<byte>)` streaming path: **8.9 µs** (3% faster wall-clock vs `Save() → byte[]`).
- All Phase 1 wall-clock targets crushed: 100-page < 500 ms target = 264.7 µs actual ≈ **~1,890× headroom**.

- Per-task subtask log in [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) covers tasks 1–25 with rationale and verification.

### Test counts
- **1546 unit tests** + 11 cross-project tests = 1557 total passing (1 skipped pin-capture utility).
- **72 determinism harness tests** (18 shapes × 4 property checks).
- **4 JIT/AOT parity tests** (factory determinism + native binary parity, including output-path verification).
- **23 BenchmarkDotNet benchmarks** with per-platform pinned baseline + +25% regression gate.

### Phase 1 exit criteria status
1. ✅ All Phase 1 task tests pass.
2. ✅ UCD reference tests pass: UAX #9 100%, UAX #14 99.952%, UAX #29 (grapheme stage) 100%.
3. ✅ Byte-determinism test passes (per-platform SHA-256 pin + 72 property tests).
4. ✅ AOT smoke publishes and runs successfully on `osx-arm64` (Linux + Windows pinned in Phase 5 CI matrix).
5. ✅ Programmatic `PdfDocument` construction works end-to-end and produces valid PDF 1.7 bytes that open in Acrobat / Firefox / Chrome / macOS Preview (verified via the AOT smoke output).
6. ⏸️ qpdf `--check` deferred to Phase 5 CI — `qpdf` is not yet a local dev dep; Phase 5 wires it into the cross-platform validation matrix.
7. ✅ Roboto-Regular WOFF 2.0 loads, subsets, and embeds end-to-end.
8. ✅ Performance baseline meets target (~1,890× headroom on the 100-page metric).
9. ✅ CHANGELOG updated, `0.1.0-alpha` tagged.

### Known gaps (post-Phase-1)
- **Word boundaries (UAX #29 stage 14.2)** and **sentence boundaries (UAX #29 stage 14.3)** — needed by Phase 2/3 layout, deferred from Phase 1's grapheme-cluster scope.
- **Non-ASCII metadata** — `PdfLiteralString` rejects `char > 0x7E`; the Phase 2 facade will route via `PdfHexString` (UTF-16BE) automatically. Documented in `docs/compatibility-matrix.md`.
- **Cross-platform pinned hashes** for `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`, `win-x64` — captured by the Phase 5 CI matrix when it lands.
- **AVIF benchmark** — deferred to Phase 5 cross-platform CI (libavif unavailable on macOS dev hosts).
- **`HtmlPdf.Convert(html)`** — public facade not yet wired (Phase 2 work). Phase 1 ships only the byte-writer surface; the public API throws `NotImplementedException` on call.
